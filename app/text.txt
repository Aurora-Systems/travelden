For the button in the header, here are a few great options depending on the action you want users to take:  

ðŸ”¹ **"Book Your Trip"** â€“ If you want visitors to start the booking process immediately.  
ðŸ”¹ **"Plan Your Journey"** â€“ If you offer customized travel planning.  
ðŸ”¹ **"Get a Quote"** â€“ If users need pricing before booking.  
ðŸ”¹ **"Explore Destinations"** â€“ If you want them to browse available trips.  
ðŸ”¹ **"Contact Us"** â€“ If your focus is on customer inquiries.  

If Travel Denâ€™s main goal is conversions (bookings), **"Book Your Trip"** would be the best choice. Let me know if you prefer a different approach! ðŸ˜Š
